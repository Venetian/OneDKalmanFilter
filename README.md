OneDKalmanFilter
================

An openFrameworks Kalman filter example for beat tracking or other one dimesional systems with a simple position and velocity

Requires the ofxCv.h add-on, maybe ofxOpenCv too

first generate a project using project generator and include these two add ons

test that builds and does nothing

then swap out the src file for these

this is very simple code that just prints to the console
